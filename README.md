# -Coffee-Survey-Java-Program
The Coffee Survey Program is a Java console app that collects ratings for five coffee types using a 5-point Likert scale. It validates input with exception handling, displays ratings as stars, and calculates the average score. This project demonstrates Java basics like arrays, loops, input handling, and output formatting.
